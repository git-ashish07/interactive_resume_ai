# Interactive Resume (AI-powered)

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered interactive resume web app. It allows users to chat with a virtual assistant representing your professional background, skills, and experience. The assistant answers questions based on your linkedin profile and summary, and can record user interest or unanswered questions using Pushover notifications.

## Features
- **AI Chatbot**: Users interact with a chatbot that answers questions about your career, skills, and experience.
- **Linkedin Profile & Summary Integration**: The assistant uses your linkedin profile (`linkedin.pdf`) and summary (`summary.txt`) for context.
- **Pushover Notifications**: Records user interest (email/name/notes) and logs unknown questions via Pushover API.
- **Gradio Web Interface**: Clean, interactive UI for chatting with the assistant.
