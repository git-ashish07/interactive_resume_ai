My name is Ashish, a passionate GenAI enthusiast and data scientist originally from Jaipur, India.
I have a deep love for sports and enjoy playing all sorts of games. I love playing PC games as well, I have played a good amount of those and am not stopping anytime soon.
I'm passionate about developing AI solutions and exploring new technologies in the field. This has been my go-to thing in recent times, I enjoy this.
When I'm not coding or playing around with data, you'll find me either on the field playing sports or immersed in the latest PC games.
